Network Neuroscience Reveals Distinct Neuromarkers of Flow During Media Use

This repo contains the .json objects necessary to replicate the experimental conditions conducted in this study (using Asteroid Impact https://github.com/richardhuskey/asteroid_impact). It also includes code and de-identified group-level data necessary to recreate the analyses reported in:

# This project includes:

1. Python code for generating brain network graphs on fMRI data using the Power 264 atlas
2. The resulting (de-identified) raw group-level graphs
3. Matlab code for analysing these graphs
4. The .json objects that defined each experimental condition using the open-source experimental stimulus Asteroid Impact (https://github.com/richardhuskey/asteroid_impact)

NB: point 3 (above) requires the GAT and BCT toolboxes

* BCT: https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/ 
* GAT: https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/gat_user_forum
* The Matlab code is also dependent on the Matlab Parallel Computing Toolbox, Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox, and the Bioinformatics Toolbox
